                        <p>Automobile racing began soon after the invention of the gasoline(petrol)
                            fueled
                            internal-combustion engine in the 1880s. The first organized automobile competition,
                            a
                            reliability
                            test in 1894 from Paris to Rouen, France, a distance of about 80 km (50 mi), was won
                            with an
                            average
                            speed of 16.4 kph (10.2 mph). In 1895 the first true race was held, from Paris to
                            Bordeaux,
                            France,
                            and back, a distance of 1,178 km. The winner made an average speed of 24.15 kph.
                            Organized
                            automobile racing began in the United States with an 87-km race from Chicago to
                            Evanston,
                            Illinois,
                            and back on Thanksgiving Day in 1895. Both early races were sponsored by newspapers
                            for
                            promotional
                            purposes. In Europe, town-to-town races in France, or from France to other
                            countries, became
                            the
                            norm until 1903 when authorities stopped the Paris-to-Madrid race at Bordeaux
                            because of the
                            large
                            number of accidents. The first closed-circuit road race, the Course de PÃ©rigueux,
                            was run in
                            1898, a
                            distance of 145 km on one lap. Such racing, governed by the Automobile Club de
                            France
                            (founded in
                            1895), came to prevail in Europe except for England, Wales, and Scotland. By 1900
                            racers had
                            achieved speeds of more than 80.46 kph. Danger to spectators, racers, and livestock
                            on roads
                            not
                            built for the automobile, let alone racing, ultimately caused road races to decrease
                            in
                            number. A
                            notable exception was the Mille Miglia, which was not stopped until 1957.
                            International racing in the modern sense began after James Gordon Bennett, owner of
                            The New
                            York
                            Herald, offered a trophy to be competed for annually by national automobile clubs,
                            racing
                            three cars
                            each that had been built of parts made in the respective countries. The Automobile
                            Club de
                            France
                            organized the first Bennett Trophy races in 1901, 1902, and 1903. The event was
                            later held
                            at the
                            Circuit of Ireland (1903), the Taunus Rundstrecke in Germany (1904), and the Circuit
                            dâAuvergne
                            (1905). The unwillingness of French manufacturers to be limited to three cars led to
                            their
                            boycott
                            of the Bennett Trophy Race in 1906 and the establishment of the first French Grand
                            Prix Race
                            at Le
                            Mans in that year, the cars being raced by manufacturersâ teams. The first Targa
                            Florio was
                            run in
                            Sicily the same year and thereafter except during wartime at distances varying from
                            72 to
                            1,049 km.
                        </p>
                        <h5 id="item-1">Formula One</h5>
                        <p>
                            Formula One is a global leviathan. In 2017, its global audience was 352.3 million
                            people.
                            The
                            sponsorship income of the manufacturers is in the hundreds of millions of Euros per
                            year.
                            The top
                            speed of the Formula One car is 231 miles per hour. Put simply, everything in
                            Formula One is
                            done to
                            a huge scale. One of Formula Oneâs greatest strengths is the fact that â despite all
                            of the
                            engineering expertise and technology â it is a simple sport.
                            There is something inherently visceral about watching incredibly skilled drivers
                            hurtle
                            hugely quick
                            cars around a race track. Despite the ever-growing speed, Formula One is a safer
                            sport now
                            than ever
                            in its history. Indeed, throughout its nearly 80 year past, Formula One has, every
                            year,
                            become both
                            faster and safer. This is the real engineering skill of the sport.

                        <p>
                            Ever since there have been cars, there has been car racing. As technology improved,
                            and
                            cars became
                            more numerous, European manufacturers began racing as a way of competing and
                            marketing their
                            products.
                            In the interwar years, a series of Grands Prix took place throughout Europe,
                            designed to
                            show off
                            car and driver skills to a receptive European population.

                            Had World War II not intervened it is likely that Formula One would have begun much
                            earlier.
                            Certainly, in the interwar years, there was an increasing move towards codifying the
                            sport
                            from the
                            ragtag one-off events.
                            With the rise of Nazism, and the focus of French and Belgian (and other European)
                            engineers
                            onto
                            preparation for war, however, Formula One was put on hold until 1946.

                            The name âFormula Oneâ refers to a standardized set of rules with which drivers and
                            engineers must
                            comply. In 1946, the idea of a Formula One Championship began. From 1946-1950 the
                            races were
                            not
                            part of an overall calendar and races tended to be ad hoc affairs.

                        <h5 id="item-1-4">EVOLUTION OF RACING</h5>
                        <p>
                            After WORLD WAR II, Formula One was an established sport, with a great deal of
                            popularity.
                            Gradually, in the post-war years, F1 underwent a series of evolutionary changes. For
                            example, in
                            1958, the Grands Prix were shortened from 300 miles to 200 miles, and the fuel used
                            by
                            drivers was
                            standardized to Avgas.
                            1958 was also a landmark year as it was the first year that a car with an engine
                            mounted
                            behind the
                            driver won the championship. Stirling Mossâs Cooper won the Argentine Grand Prix in
                            his
                            newly
                            designed car, which soon became the standard across all manufacturers.
                            In 1965, a Japanese team won the Mexican Grand Prix with a transverse engine. Unlike
                            Stirling Mossâs
                            car, however, no other manufacturers copied the design of the Japanese car, which
                            remains
                            the only
                            car to have done so with an engine of that type.
                            This Grand Prix was also the last that saw the use of a 1.5-liter engine before the
                            loads
                            were
                            increased to 3.0 liters. This naturally increased the speeds that cars are capable
                            of
                            achieving, and
                            they now regularly top 200 mph â a speed more than double the top speed of the
                            earliest
                            racing cars.
                            By far the biggest evolution that has taken place in the period since WWII has been
                            the
                            international spread of Formula One. Races are now truly spread throughout the
                            globe, with
                            races on
                            almost every continent.
                            This has meant that Formula One now has fans, constructors, and drivers from all
                            over the
                            world.
                            With races in Bahrain, China, Brazil, and Abu Dhabi, Formula One is quickly becoming
                            a sport
                            that
                            transcends national boundaries. Indeed, more and more, fansâ loyalty is to the car
                            manufacturers
                            rather than the racing drivers.

                        <h5 id="item-1-5">DEVELOPMENTS IN CAR TECHNOLOGY</h5>
                        <p>
                            Car technology in Formula One has been a result of each team constantly striving to
                            gain a
                            competitive advantage.
                            The two biggest developments that have taken place in the history of Formula One
                            have been
                            the
                            placement of the engine and the material of the chassis. As mentioned above, in 1958
                            Stirling Mossâs
                            car featured a behind-driver engine.
                            For the first time since the replacement of horses, cars were now pushed rather than
                            pulled,
                            giving
                            greater control over the steering. Modern safety innovations have meant that the
                            engine is
                            now
                            placed in the center of the car, although this is still behind the driver.
                            The most radical change that took place with the chassis was the development, in
                            1962, of
                            the
                            aluminum sheet monocoque, which effectively meant that the car was one long body
                            panel.
                            This dramatically reduced weight and made the cars more rigid, meaning that even
                            greater
                            speeds were
                            possible. In 1981 McLaren superseded this with the development of the carbon fiber
                            chassis.
                            Other developments, like active suspension, turbochargers, and traction control were
                            all
                            innovations
                            that have been banned sporadically throughout the history of Formula One, showing
                            that the
                            eponymous
                            regulations of Formula One have also been forced to innovate throughout its history.

                        <h5 id="item-1-6">SAFETY DEVELOPMENT</h5>
                        <p>
                            Concurrent with the development in speed and aerodynamics of Formula 1 cars has been
                            innovation in
                            safety. In the period 1963-1967, an estimated 256,000 kilometers were driven under
                            race
                            conditions,
                            resulting in three driver fatalities.
                            Since 1997, there have been an estimated 348,000 kilometers driven under race
                            conditions,
                            with zero
                            fatalities.
                            Interestingly, the number of accidents per kilometer has actually increased in that
                            period,
                            due to
                            the increased speed driven by cars. Safety innovations have therefore made it so
                            that
                            crashes are
                            less likely to result in death or serious injury for drivers. Crashes that take
                            place now
                            would have
                            been fatal in the past. Through constant innovation, Formula One is now safer than
                            at any
                            point.
                        </p>
                        <h5>THE 1960s</h5>
                        <p>
                            The first set of innovations that took place in the 1960s were centered on the
                            danger
                            caused by
                            fires in the post-crash period. For example, in the period 1963-1965, cars were
                            required to
                            be
                            fitted with fire protection, safer fuel tanks (and gas lines), and fireproof suits
                            were made
                            mandatory for all drivers.
                            Cockpits and safety belts began to be designed for easy release and exit in the case
                            of a
                            crash. In
                            this period also were modern crash helmets (i.e. shatterproof) and roll bars fitted
                            to
                            prevent the
                            initial danger of a crash.
                            Safety was increasingly becoming a priority in this period. The FIA began a system
                            of
                            standardized
                            inspections, run by FIA officials. Prior to this, the inspections had been
                            undertaken by
                            national
                            authorities. In 1963, the modern flag signaling system was introduced to warn other
                            drivers
                            of a
                            crash ahead (as well as pass other safety-related messages).
                        </p>
                        <h5>THE 1970s</h5>
                        <p>
                            In the 1970s spectator safety became increasingly important, and a number of
                            regulations
                            were
                            introduced that were designed to protect those who attended these events. For
                            example, in
                            1970 it
                            became compulsory for circuits to have spectators three meters behind any fencing
                            (and
                            fencing was
                            increasingly regulated).
                            In 1973 âcatchfencesâ were introduced to prevent cars from being able to endanger
                            spectators. Where
                            previously hay bales had been used as a crash barrier, this was now made illegal
                            because of
                            the fire
                            hazard presented.
                            The dangers of fire were also continually addressed for drivers, as safety bladders
                            in fuel
                            tanks
                            were introduced in 1970, and safety foam in the tanks became mandatory in 1972. In
                            1973, the
                            FIA
                            mandated the use of crushable structures around fuel tanks (again, to prevent the
                            danger of
                            a crash
                            causing rupturing and leaking).
                            Starting in 1978, drivers were compelled to have a license to qualify to drive,
                            allowing the
                            FIA to
                            introduce more rigorous standards on driver training.
                        </p>
                        <h5>THE 1980s</h5>
                        <p>
                            In the 1980s technology had advanced to the extent that it was now possible to
                            protect the
                            driver in
                            all but the most serious crashes.
                            Knowledge of crumple zones and the introduction of a âsurvival cellâ around the
                            driver meant
                            that
                            crashes themselves became increasingly less fatal. This ran concurrently with
                            increasing
                            innovation
                            with regard to fire, and a growing presence of medical staff on hand at races.
                            The biggest change in respect to fire was that in 1984 it was banned for drivers to
                            refuel
                            during
                            races. The fuel tank was also placed in the center of the car, meaning it was
                            further
                            protected from
                            impact.

                        <h5>THE 1990s</h5>
                        <p>
                            In the 1990s, cars were increasingly modified to be faster, and safety innovations
                            were
                            increasingly
                            based on more precise details.
                            For example, design specifications became even more rigorous. In 1993, the mandatory
                            headrest area
                            was increased to four meters, the front overhang was reduced from one meter to 90
                            centimeters, and
                            additional regulations gave very specific details about the distance of the rear
                            wing
                            height, the
                            distance of the front wing endplate, and the wheel width.
                            More and more of the technology was taken away from drivers, thereby forcing them to
                            be
                            fully
                            engaged with their drive. For example, in 1994, traction control, automatic gear,
                            and
                            anti-lock
                            brakes were banned.
                        </p>
                        <h5>2000 ONWARDS</h5>
                        <p>
                            The safety changes that have taken place since 2000 have almost all been centered
                            around
                            increasing
                            the different forces that cars are able to respond to, meaning that drivers are
                            protected in
                            an even
                            larger array of cases.
                            For example, in 2000 the âsurvival cell panel outer skin laminatesâ were fitted with
                            added
                            penetration resistance, and the static load side test in the driverâs leg areas
                            increased by
                            20%. In
                            2001, the side impact test speed was increased to 10 m/s.
                            This suggests that the fundamental structures of the car are sound, and the primary
                            innovations are
                            involved in adjustments, rather than major radical change.

                        <h5 id="item-2" class="text-secondary">History of the 24 hour circuit of Le Mans</h5>
                        <p>The legendary 24 Hours of Le Mans car race has been going on since 1923.
                            The
                            origin of the
                            Circuit
                            de la Sarthe is linked to the organization of the 1906 French Automobile Grand Prix
                            - the
                            first
                            French Grand Prix. The Automobile Club de l'Ouest dreamed of a competition that
                            would
                            contribute to
                            the development of technical progress and the development of the automobile. In
                            1922, the
                            club
                            announced the creation of a new type of competition in the Sarthe, an endurance
                            event . This
                            event
                            then takes place mainly on classic road tracks between Le Mans, La FertÃ©-Bernard and
                            Saint-Calais,
                            so as to reproduce the driving conditions of amateur motorists. The 24 Hours of Le
                            Mans was
                            inspired
                            by the idea of ââan ephemeral circuit which today is still only used about ten days
                            a year.

                            The first edition of this 24 Hours endurance grand prix took place on May 26 and 27,
                            1923.
                            It was
                            then the first round of the Rudge-Whitworth Cup. The event, which brought together
                            thirty-three
                            crews, was won by drivers AndrÃ© Lagache and RenÃ© LÃ©onard on Chenard and Walcker. The
                            lap
                            record for
                            the Bentley 3 Liter n Â° 8 in 9 min. 39 sec. was established during the last hour of
                            the
                            race, when
                            this car had already exceeded its mileage target.

                        <h5 id="item-2-1" class="text-secondary">Characteristics of the Le Mans circuit</h5>
                        <p>With a track length of 13.626 km, the Sarthe circuit is one of the longest
                            racing
                            circuits
                            in the
                            world . Its originality is the use of three quarters of road sections which remain
                            open to
                            public
                            traffic during the rest of the year. The most famous passages are the bends of
                            Tertre Rouge
                            ,
                            Mulsanne, Indianapolis or Arnage , with the long straight line of the HunaudiÃ¨res
                            of nearly
                            6km,
                            called "Mulsanne straight", without forgetting the Dunlop chicaneand its gateway.
                            Over the
                            years,
                            the configuration of the famous racing circuit has evolved, above all with a view to
                            safety.

                            For the first edition, in 1923, the route linked the eastern suburbs of Le Mans to
                            the
                            Pontlieue
                            hairpin for 17.3 kilometers. The construction of the Bugatti circuit in 1966 was a
                            first
                            change.
                            This permanent track is then used, during the 24 Hours of Le Mans, for its pits. In
                            1972,
                            the old
                            ultra-fast and dangerous section of âWhite Houseâ was diverted thanks to the
                            achievement of
                            the
                            Porsche turn. In 1990, the addition of chicanes on the famous straight line of the
                            HunaudiÃ¨res aims
                            to limit the speed differences between the competitors.

                        <h5 id="item-2-2" class="text-secondary">Starting procedure</h5>
                        <p>The special âLe Mans-style startâ lasted until 1970. The drivers were lined up on the left of
                            the track, one behind the other, opposite their cars which were parked on the right. When
                            the French flag was lowered, they ran to their cars, started their engines and set off
                            around the track. For safety reasons, the starting procedure was eventually changed: now,
                            after a formation lap, there is a rolling start.
                        </p>
                        <h5 id="item-2-3" class="text-secondary">CLASSES</h5>
                        <p>The French endurance classic is part of the FIA WEC World Endurance Championship and is split
                            into four classes: Le Mans Prototype 1 (LMP1) hybrid and non-hybrid, Le Mans Prototype 2
                            (LMP2) , Le Mans Grand Tourisme Endurance Pro (LMGTE Pro), and Le Mans Grand Tourisme
                            Endurance Am (LMGTE Am), each class with its own technical specifications (engines
                            permitted, chassis, etc.). For this, the 88th staging of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, there are
                            five cars in the LMP1 class, 24 in LMP2, eight in LMGTE Pro, and 22 in LMGTE Am, making a
                            total 59 teams.

                        <p>Rally is a form of motorsport that takes place on public or private roads with modified
                            production or specially built road-legal cars. It is distinguished by not running on a
                            circuit, but instead in a point-to-point format in which participants and their co-drivers
                            drive between set control points (special stages), leaving at regular intervals from one or
                            more start points. Rallies may be won by pure speed within the stages or alternatively by
                            driving to a predetermined ideal journey time within the stages.
                        </p>
                        <h5 id="item-3-1" class="text-warning">Pre-World War I</h5>
                        <p>The term "rally", as a branch of motorsport, probably dates from the first Monte Carlo Rally
                            of January 1911. Until the late 1920s, few if any other events used the term. Rallying
                            itself can be traced back to the 1894 ParisâRouen Horseless Carriage Competition (Concours
                            des Voitures sans Chevaux), sponsored by a Paris newspaper, Le Petit Journal, which
                            attracted considerable public interest and entries from leading manufacturers. Prizes were
                            awarded to the vehicles by a jury based on the reports of the observers who rode in each
                            car; the official winner was Albert LemaÃ®tre driving a 3 hp Peugeot, although the Comte de
                            Dion had finished first, but his steam-powered vehicle was ineligible for the official
                            competition. This event led directly to a period of city-to-city road races in France and
                            other European countries, which introduced many of the features found in later rallies:
                            individual start times with cars running against the clock rather than head to head; time
                            controls at the entry and exit points of towns along the way; road books and route notes;
                            and driving over long distances on ordinary, mainly gravel, roads, facing hazards such as
                            dust, traffic, pedestrians and farm animals.
                        </p>
                        <h5 id="item-3-2" class="text-warning">Interwar years</h5>
                        <p>The First World War brought a lull to rallying. The Monte Carlo Rally was not resuscitated
                            until 1924, but since then, apart from World War II and its aftermath, it has been an annual
                            event and remains a regular round of the World Rally Championship. In the 1930s, helped by
                            the tough winters, it became the premier European rally, attracting 300 or more
                            participants.

                            In the 1920s, numerous variations on the Alpine theme sprang up in Austria, Italy, France,
                            Switzerland and Germany. The most important of these were Austria's Alpenfahrt, which
                            continued into its 44th edition in 1973, Italy's Coppa delle Alpi, and the Coupe
                            Internationale des Alpes (International Alpine Trial), organised jointly by the automobile
                            clubs of Italy, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and, latterly, France. This last event, run
                            from 1928 to 1936, attracted strong international fields vying for an individual Glacier Cup
                            or a team Alpine Cup, including successful Talbot, Riley, MG and Triumph teams from Britain
                            and increasingly strong and well funded works representation from Adolf Hitler's Germany,
                            keen to prove its engineering and sporting prowess with successful marques like Adler,
                            Wanderer and Trumpf

                        <p>Rallying was again slow to get under way after a major war, but the 1950s were the Golden Age
                            of the long-distance road rally. In Europe, the Monte Carlo Rally, the French and Austrian
                            Alpines, and the LiÃ¨ge were joined by a host of new events that quickly established
                            themselves as classics: the Lisbon Rally (Portugal, 1947), the Tulip Rally (the Netherlands,
                            1949), the Rally to the Midnight Sun (Sweden, 1951, now the Swedish Rally), the Rally of the
                            1000 Lakes (Finland, 1951 â now the Rally Finland), and the Acropolis Rally (Greece,
                            1956). The RAC Rally gained International status on its return in 1951, but for 10 years
                            its emphasis on map-reading navigation and short manoevrability tests made it unpopular with
                            foreign crews. The FIA created in 1953 a European Rally Championship (at first called
                            the "Touring Championship") of eleven events; it was first won by Helmut Polensky of
                            Germany.

                        <h5 id="item-3-4" class="text-warning">Modern times</h5>
                        <p>The introduction of the special stage brought rallying effectively into the modern era. It
                            placed a premium on fast driving, and enabled healthy programmes of smaller events to spring
                            up in Britain, France, Scandinavia, Belgium and elsewhere.

                            Since then, the nature of the events themselves has evolved relatively slowly. The
                            increasing costs, both of organization and of competing, as well as safety concerns, have,
                            over the last twenty years, brought progressively shorter rallies, shorter stages and the
                            elimination of nighttime running, scornfully referred to as "office hours rallying" by older
                            hands. Some of the older international events have gone, replaced by others from a much
                            wider spread of countries around the world, until today rallying is truly a worldwide sport.
                            At the same time, fields have shrunk dramatically, as the amateur in his near-standard car
                            is squeezed out.

                            Gruelling long-distance events continued to be run. In 1967, a group of American offroaders
                            created the Mexican 1000 Rally, a tough 1,000-mile race for cars and motorcycles which ran
                            the length of the Baja California peninsula, much of it initially over roadless desert,
                            which quickly gained fame as the Baja 1000, today run by the SCORE organization. "Baja"
                            events now take place in a number of other countries worldwide.
